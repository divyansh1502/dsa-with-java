## ðŸš€ About

This repository contains all my code snippets, assignments, notes, and solutions from the **Java DSA Bootcamp** by **Kunal Kushwaha**.  
The aim is to build a strong foundation in algorithms & data structures, improve problem-solving skills, and get ready for interviews (LeetCode / FAANG / other companies).  
Course is free to follow; everything here is for learning & revision.
